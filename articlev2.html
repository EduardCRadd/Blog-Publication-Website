        <p class="article2__text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Injustice is sin. Lying too, is a sin against the same goddess: her name is Truth, and she is the original cause of all that is true. The conscious liar sins to the extent that his deceit causes injustice: the unconscious liar to the extent that he is out of tune with the nature of the Whole and out of order with the nature of the ordered universe against which he fights. And it is fighting when he allows himself to be carried in opposition to the truth. He has received the prompts from nature: by ignoring them he is now incapable of distinguishing false from true.</p>
        <p class="article2__text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the pursuit of pleasure as a good and the avoidance of pain as an evil constitutes sin. Someone like that must inevitably and frequently blame universal Nature for unfair distribution as between bad men and good, since bad men are often deep in pleasures and the possessions which make for pleasure, while the good often meet with pain and the circumstances which cause pain. Further, anyone who fears pain will also at times be afraid of some future event in the world, and that is immediate sin.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="article2__text-column article2__text-column--6">
        <p class="article2__text">And a man who pursues pleasure will not hold back from injustice - an obvious sin. Those who wish to follow Nature and share her mind must themselves be indifferent to those pairs of opposites to which universal Nature is indifferent - she would not create these opposites if she were not indifferent either way. So</p>

      <div class="article2__text-column article2__text-column--7">
        <p class="article2__text">anyone who is not himself indifferent to pain and pleasure, death and life, fame and obscurity - things which universal Nature treats indifferently - is clearly committing a sin. By 'universal Nature treating these things indifferently' mean that they happen impartially by cause and effect to all that comes into being and owes its being to the fulfilment of an original impulse of Providence. Under this impulse Providence set out from a first premise to establish the present order of the universe: she had conceived certain principles of what was to be, and determined generative powers to create substances, transformations, and successive regeneration. A man of sense and sensitivity would depart</p>

        <p class="article2__text">the company of men without ever tasting falsehood, pretence of any kind, excess, or pomp. The next best course is at least to sicken of these things before your final breath. Or do you prefer to sit at table with wickedness? Has your experience not yet persuaded you to shun this plague? Because the corruption of the mind is much more a plague than any such contaminating change in the surrounding air we breathe. The latter infects animate creatures in their animate nature: the former infects human beings in their humanity.</p>
        <p class="article2__text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not despise death: welcome it, rather, as one further part of nature's will. Our very dissolution is just like all the other natural processes which life's seasons bring - like youth and old age, growth and maturity, development of teeth and beard and grey hair, insemination, pregnancy, and childbirth. In the educated attitude to death, then, there is nothing superficial or demanding or disdainful: simply awaiting it as one of the functions of nature. And just as</p>

        <p class="article2__text">you may now be waiting for the child your wife carries to come out of the womb, so you should look forward to the time when your soul will slip this bodily sheath. If you want another criterion - unscientific but emotionally effective - you will find it quite easy to face death if you stop to consider the business you will be leaving and the sort of characters which will no longer contaminate your soul. You must not of course take offence at them, rather care for them and tolerate them kindly: but still remember that the deliverance death brings is not deliverance from the like-minded. This alone, if anything could, might pull you back and hold you to life - if you were allowed to live in the company of people who share your principles. But</p>
      </div>

      <div class="article2__text-column article2__text-column--3">
        <p class="article2__text">as things are you see how wearisome it is to live out of tune with your fellows, so that you say: "Come quickly, death, or I too may forget myself.' These will suffice: the present certainty of judgement, the 6 present social action, the present disposition well content with any effect of an external cause. Erase the print of imagination, stop impulse, quench desire: keep your directing mind its own master.</p>
        <p class="article2__text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irrational creatures share in one animate soul, and rational creatures partake in one intelligent soul: just as there is one earth for all the things of earth, and one light to see by, one air to breathe for all of us who have sight and life.</p>
        <p class="article2__text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things which share some common quality tend to their own kind. Everything earthy inclines to earth. Everything watery flows together, and the same with air, so they need physical obstacles to force a separation. Fire rises upwards because of the elemental fire, but is nevertheless so eager to help the ignition of any fire here below that any material which is a little too dry is easily ignited, for the lack of ingredients which hinder combustion.</p>
        <p class="article2__text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So too everything which shares in a common intelligent nature tends equally, or yet more so, to its own kind.  Proportionate to its superiority over the rest, it is that much readie-to mix and blend with its family.</p>
        <p class="article2__text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So right from the beginning among the irrational creatures there could be seen hives, flocks, birds rearing their young, a ther of love: already there were animate souls at work there, and in the higher orders an increasingly strong collective bond which is not found in plants or stones or wood. And among the rational creatures there were civic communities, friendships, households, assemblies: and in war treaties and truces. Among yet higher things there exists a sort of unity even at a distance, As with the stars. Thus the upper reaches of the scale of being can effect fellow-feeling even when the members are far apart.</p>
        <p class="article2__text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look then at what is happening now. Only the intelligent creatures have now forgotten that urge to be unified with each other: only here will you see no confluence. They may run from it, but nevertheless they are overtaken: such is the power of nature. Look carefully and you will see what I mean. You are more likely to find earth not not returning to earth.</p>

        <p class="article2__text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, god, and the universe all bear fruit, each in its own due season. No matter if common use confines the strict sense of 'bearing fruit' to vines and the like. Reason too has its fruit, both universal and particular: other things grow from it which share its own nature.</p>
        <p class="article2__text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It If you can, show them the better way. If you cannot, remember that this is why you have the gift of kindness. The gods too are kind to such people, and in their benevolence even help them achieve some ends - health, wealth, fame. You can do it too. Or tell me - who is stopping you?</p>
        <p class="article2__text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work. Don't work as a miserable drudge, or in any expectation of pity or admiration. One aim only: action or inaction as civic cause demands. Today I escaped from all bothering</p>

        <p class="article2__text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good or ill for the rational social being lies not in feeling but 16 in action: just as also his own virtue or vice shows not in what he feels, but in what he does.</p>

Penetrate into their directing minds, and you will see what sort of critics you fear - and what poor critics they are of themselves. All things are in a process of change. You yourself are subject 19 to constant alteration and gradual decay. So too is the whole universe. You should leave another's wrong where it lies</p>
        <p class="article2__text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The termination of an activity, the pause when an impulse or judgement is finished - this is a sort of death, but no harm in it. Turn now to the stages of your life - childhood, say, adolescence, prime, old age. Here too each change a death: anything fearful there? Turn now to your life with your grandfather, then with your mother, then with your [adoptive] father. And as you find many other examples of</p>

To your own mind, to make its understanding just; to the mind of the Whole, to recall what you are part of; to this man's mind, to see whether there is ignorance or design - and at the same time to reflect that his is a kindred mind.</p>
        <p class="article2__text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as you yourself are a complementary part of a social system, so too your every action should complement a life of social principle. If any action of yours, then, does not have direct or indirect</p>

You will realize that there is no need to be racked with anxiety that they should hold any particular opinion about you. But you should still be kind to them. They are by nature your friends, and the gods too help them in various ways - dreams and divination - at least to the objects of their concern.</p>
